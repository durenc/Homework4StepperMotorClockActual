Here is the video of it homing and calibrating
The connection took too long and ended up timing out, and when it does it will set the motors to the time 18:00.  It will eventually connect and get the actual time, which is shown in the other 2 videos.
Please excuse the camera work, the motor tried to slip out on me so I had to hold it with one hand and record with the other.
This video and the other 2 were recorded with no manual intervention in between, the connection time would've made the video way too long otherwise.
You should be able to copy this link and paste it to view it in google drive.
Enjoy!
